%=== Introduction ============================================
\chapter{Introduction}
Fisheries modeling take the complexity of a single heterogeneous stock with different sizes, ages, growth rates, movement patterns, reproductive abilities, behaviors in response to fishing gear, and risks of natural mortality and simplify these diverse dynamics into a cohesive model. These stock assessment models look at data such as the number of fish caught, total biomass over a certain range, catch per unit area, and mean size (weight or length) of fish harvested and attempt to predict how these attributes will respond to fishing over time. Depending on the available data and level of complexity desired, we can model open ocean ecosystems using several different approaches. Most models focus on an individual stock and fall under the category of a single-species model. The simplest single-species models look only at abundance and are referred to as biomass dynamic or production models. These models can be extended in three ways. They can include age-structure, the dynamics of fleets, spatial structure, and interactions with other species and the environment. The models that include species interactions and environmental fluctuations are a special class of models referred to as ecosystem-based models.

\vspace{5mm}

A multitude of ecosystem-based models have been developed within the past three decades to address the need to incorporate ecosystem-based science into fisheries management. These models help inform decision-makers about the effects of fishing mortality and the indirect trophic implications of fishing in changing ecological environments. There are various types of ecosystem-based models: whole ecosystem and dynamic system models, minimum realistic models (restrict a model to those species most likely to have important interactions with the species of interest), individual-based models (follow an individual through their life cycle), and bioenergetics models (use bioenergetics and allometric reasoning) \cite{plaganyi2004critical,collie2014ecosystem}. All of these classes of models aim to simulate the environment by including species interactions and environmental fluctuations. 

\vspace{5mm}

Instead of attempting to explain all the ecological processes in one model, a new possible approach is to move away from focusing on small-scale details and look at the ecosystem in a broader context. We can combine ecosystem-knowledge to improve upon single-species models. For instance by applying ecological theory such as food web dynamics, we can develop a more feasible approach to estimate the unfished biomass and carrying capacity. By taking the amount of net primary production that enters into the system, we can use the principle behind energy transfer in food webs to approximate the amount of biomass at each trophic level. By taking a bottom-up approach, we can ensure that our estimates of unfished biomass are feasible, because we account for how much energy goes into the system. We can additionally include sensitivity analysis in our model to account for the natural variation in the environment.

\chapter{Tangled is the web we weave}
%---  Section -------------------------
\section{Introduction}
One of the crucial, and at times, most puzzling concepts in food web dynamics research is the transfer efficiency-?the movement of production between trophic levels. This paper addresses two aspects of transfer efficiency: first, we seek to provide clarity and untangle the web of confusion surrounding the conceptualization of transfer efficiency. Second, we address the often-cited claim that transfer efficiency is a constant 10\%. We analyze extant research to show that transfer efficiency varies substantially across systems, trophic levels, and taxa. 

\subsection{Origin and conceptualization of transfer efficiency}
The definition of transfer efficiency has been somewhat muddled since its inception. We refer to transfer efficiency as the fraction of production passing from one trophic level to the next \cite{slobodkin1959energetics}. At times it has also been referred to as trophic (transfer) efficiency \cite{chapman1998ecology}. This term is often confused with other non-equivalent efficiencies such as ecological efficiency, assimilation efficiency, and consumption efficiency \cite{iverson1990control, hairston1993causeeffect}. However, each of these efficiencies addresses distinct ecological questions and thus require different data for their calculations. \citet{slobodkin1959energetics} theorized a food chain efficiency metric and defined it as the ratio of the number of organisms removed from the targeted population to the food consumed by the targeted population \cite{slobodkin1960ecological,slobodkin1962energy}. Removal includes both natural mortality and human harvesting. He subsequently renamed the concept ``ecological efficiency" in his 1962 and 1972 papers \cite{slobodkin1962energy, slobodkin1972inconstancy}. The energy budget requires a balance between inputs and outputs. When energy is ingested, some of that energy is lost to respiration and excretion. Then, the remaining energy that is assimilated is divided amongst basal maintenance, growth, and reproduction. Assimilation efficiency is defined as the percentage of energy ingested at trophic level $n$ that is assimilated at trophic level $n$ \cite{hairston1993causeeffect}. The consumption efficiency measures the number of organisms from the prey population that is consumed by its predators and is defined as the percentage of net production at trophic level $n$ that is consumed by trophic level $n + 1$ \cite{hairston1993causeeffect}. In an attempt to make the differences clearer, we provide a simple cartoon of a food web (Figure \ref{foodweb}) that visualizes the definitions of four of the commonly used efficiencies. 

\vspace{5mm}

Availability of data differs between ecosystems. It is difficult in aquatic systems, especially marine systems, to gather enough data on every species in order to calculate the assimilation and consumption efficiencies. Terrestrial studies, on the other hand, can collect detailed population data much easier. Thus, terrestrial studies do not need to rely as much on inferential techniques, like the transfer efficiency, and have the ability to calculate species-specific metrics, such as the assimilation and consumption efficiency. To clarify, the assimilation and consumption efficiencies can also be calculated at the trophic-level in addition to the species-level.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \label{foodweb}
\end{figure}

The confusion around the definition is not the only complication with transfer efficiency--the values themselves have been disputed over the years and remain a point of contention. It is surprising that some scholars treat transfer efficiency as a fixed constant (i.e., 10\%) for all trophic levels in light of the fact that other scholars have found that physiological, and potentially behavioral, characteristics influence transfer efficiency \cite{may1983ecology, pauly1995primary, ware2000aquatic, cury2005trophodynamic, libralato2008novel, chassot2010global, trebilco2013ecosystem, watson2014primary}.

\subsection*{Physiological and behavioral characteristics of transfer efficiency in freshwater and marine ecosystems}
Multiple factors have been shown to affect transfer efficiency in both freshwater and marine ecosystems. In freshwater systems, the sources of variability in transfer efficiencies include the body of water, season, trophic level, and species composition \cite{lindeman1942trophic, gaedke1994seasonal, rybarczyk2003analysis, karlsson2007differences}.
In marine systems, transfer efficiency varies by ecological system, geographic location, trophic level, metabolic strategy, and species composition \cite{may1983ecology, persson2007food, libralato2008novel, barnes2010global}.

\subsubsection*{Ecological system within freshwater and marine ecosystems}
Transfer efficiency has been found to be specific to the geographical region. Multiple marine studies found distinct transfer efficiencies between upwelling, temperate and tropical ecosystems (i.e., 5\% upwelling, 10\% temperate, and 14\% tropical) \cite{libralato2008novel, coll2008ecosystem, chassot2010global}. Even within a single ecosystem,
\citet{baird2004energy} found that each community within an intertidal ecosystem had unique transfer efficiency values. Distinct transfer efficiency values have also been found to occur not only between lakes and within trophic levels in freshwater ecosystems \cite{lindeman1942trophic}, but also in bays and estuaries as well \cite{rybarczyk2003analysis}.

\vspace{5mm}

Additionally, research has found that the amount of sunlight a region receives affects transfer efficiency. \citet{sanmartin2006latitudinal} suggest that transfer efficiency from phytoplankton to zooplankton in marine ecosystems decreases as latitude increases due to the decrease in sunlight. \citet{gaedke1994seasonal} found seasonal variation in transfer efficiency between the first and second trophic level in lakes, with transfer efficiency rising in the summer and fall and decreasing in the winter and spring. The seasonal variation in transfer efficiency can be attributed to the decrease in phytoplankton abundance in winter due to limited sunlight. As daylight increases in early spring, there is a gradual increase in phytoplankton blooms--culminating in the maximum phytoplankton production in summer (i.e., peak hours of sunlight).  As the days become shorter in fall and the hours of sunlight decreases, there is a decrease in the amount of phytoplankton. There is a time lag corresponding to the change in sunlight in the spring and fall seasons. Therefore, the amount of sunlight indirectly influences transfer efficiency between the first and second trophic level by directly impacting the phytoplankton abundance. 

\subsubsection*{Trophic level}
Size spectrum studies report that transfer efficiency decreases with body size, and by association, trophic level \cite{barnes2010global}. Therefore, the size ratio of prey to predators (e.g., phytoplankton to zooplankton) impacts transfer efficiency and trophic structure 
\cite{havens1998size, garciacomas2016prey}.

\subsubsection*{Metabolic strategy}
Furthermore, \citet{may1983ecology} found ectotherms are more efficient than endotherms in transferring energy from trophic level $n$ to trophic level $n+1$, with energy transfer efficiencies around 20-50\% for invertebrate ectotherms, around 10\% for vertebrate ectotherms and less than 2\% for endotherms. This discrepancy in transfer efficiency is due to the metabolic efficiency: ectotherms rely on environmental heat sources and therefore have a lower metabolic cost in comparison to endotherms. Much of the metabolic energy in endotherms goes to the production of heat. Therefore, transfer of energy in the higher trophic levels where endotherms are prominent is less than the lower trophic levels were ectotherms make up more of the composition in marine ecosystems \cite{mcgarvey2018two}.

\subsubsection*{Species composition}
Consuming nutritionally imbalanced food has been shown to lead to large respiratory losses, which negatively affect transfer efficiency \cite{persson2007food}. \citet{karlsson2007differences} and \citet{vonelert2003absence} found that the species composition of prey, in particular different species of zooplankton crustaceans and the absence of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid in cyanobacteria, influence transfer efficiency. In addition, the presence of jellyfish blooms has been found to reduce the transfer of energy to higher trophic levels \cite{condon2011jellyfish}.

\vspace{5mm}

\citet{trussell2006fear} and \citet{schmitz2008individuals} found that the risk of predation modifies prey conversion efficiencies and biomass production, which could therefore influence trophic structure and energy transfer. While these results refer specifically to assimilation and consumption efficiencies, it is plausible that this behavior influences transfer efficiencies as well. While the specific factors  previously discussed influence transfer efficiency individually, these components interact in the natural environment. Because of this interaction, researchers must consider the impacts of the synergistic effects of these factors on the variability of the transfer efficiency and in turn how to account for them in the modeling process.  

\subsection*{The 10\% transfer efficiency}
Although the studies above highlight that a number of factors can greatly affect trophic efficiencies, we still see broad use of the assumption of a constant value of 10\%. To explore how (un)reasonable this assumption might be in different contexts, we synthesize the pattern of variation that has been observed in empirical studies that measured transfer efficiencies. Our goal is to provide guidance for what is reasonable to assume and what is necessary to measure.

\vspace{5mm}

It is unclear where the 10\% transfer efficiency assumption came from. Looking back at the historical records, we find a ``tangled web" of misattributions and a general lack of empirical evidence. \citet{semper1881animal} might have come up with the theory that there is a 10\% transfer between trophic levels, but he lacked empirical evidence to back this claim \cite{mcintosh1986background}. \citet{lindeman1942trophic} developed more general theory by looking at energy flow diagrams and mentioned a progressive efficiency which is currently known as transfer efficiency. However, no explicit mention of a 10\% value shows up in this work even though he is often credited for it (i.e., Lindeman?s law of trophic transfer efficiency--\citealt{chapman1998ecology}). \citet{slobodkin1959energetics, slobodkin1972inconstancy} stated that ?the values mentioned by Lindeman, as well as other values presented by other field workers, for ecological efficiency tended to cluster around 10\%.? Yet, Lindeman never explicitly discusses the ecological efficiency. He talked about the progressive efficiency, which as mentioned previously is a different concept. Regardless, Slobodkin and his students used laboratory experiments to formalize the hypothesis that there was an approximately 10\% transfer between trophic levels \cite{slobodkin1959energetics}. He referred to this as the food chain efficiency, which was later renamed to the ecological efficiency. However in a later study, \citet{slobodkin1972inconstancy} found empirical and theoretical objections to the 10\% ecological efficiency and rejected the theory. According to \citet{mcintosh1986background}, ?Nevertheless, May (1967b) in pursuit of the ?perfect crystals? of ecology, included Slobodkin?s 1961 hypothesis in a series of community properties he described as ?constant and predictable?.? In a more recent edition of May?s Theoretical Ecology textbook , however, the authors reach a very different conclusion:

\begin{quote}
One such [generalization] in the early 1960s suggested that the food-chain efficiency for transfer of energy from one trophic level to the next was generally around 10\%. Subsequent studies showed that such food-chain efficiencies can vary over two or more orders of magnitude, from less than 0.1\% to significantly more than 10\%. Some evidence suggests such efficiencies may, other things being equal, be higher for carnivores and detritus feeders than for herbivores, possibly because biochemical conversion efficiencies are higher for animals eating plants. \cite{may2007theoretical}
\end{quote}

In Figure \ref{flowchart}, we present a flowchart showing the muddled origin of this concept. Given the unclear origin and application of the 10\% transfer efficiency assumption, this assumption warrants further analysis, which is the focus of this current study. In the following section, we synthesize studies that provide empirical estimates of transfer efficiencies.

\section*{Methods}
To explore the empirical distributions of transfer efficiencies, we collected  articles that mentioned both food web and transfer efficiency. We then selected from these studies those that included relevant data, whether model-based or empirical. While we initially hoped to include terrestrial as well as freshwater and marine studies, we found nearly all of the terrestrial studies were on the consumption and assimilation efficiency, not the transfer efficiency. Therefore, we broke our analysis into two sections: freshwater and marine and ignored terrestrial. We primarily applied exploratory data analysis techniques such as summary statistics to distinguish patterns between the systems. 

\vspace{5mm}

If the sample size was sufficient large, we also used decision tree analysis (i.e., regression trees with pruning, bagging, and random forests) and Monte Carlo simulations (See Table \ref{datafresh} and \ref{datamar}). Decision tree analysis was employed to determine which factors had the largest impact on transfer efficiency. Using an approach similar to \cite{libralato2008novel}, we clustered the marine ecosystems into the following regions: temperate shelves and seas, tropical shelves and seas, lagoons, upwelling ecosystems, and open oceans. Although we also clustered the freshwater ecosystems into lakes, springs, and ponds, the sample size of the freshwater transfer efficiency data was too small to run regression tree analysis. We used regression trees with pruning, bagging, and random forests on the marine transfer efficiency data set and used relative importance plots to determine which factors accounted for the largest sources of variation and were most useful in predicting transfer efficiency. In the discussion, we used Monte Carlo simulations to aid in the conversation.

\subsection*{Freshwater}
Many of the preliminary studies on transfer efficiency occurred in freshwater systems. All of the early studies were empirical (i.e., data used to calculate the transfer efficiency were collected either through laboratory experiments or from the field), but over time studies shifted to being increasingly model-based (i.e., data used to calculate the transfer efficiency were generated as the product of computer models). We found a total of 11 systems with transfer efficiency data (Table \ref{datafresh}). Only the empirical studies reported transfer efficiency values for multiple trophic levels. The model-based studies reported the system-wide average. Most of the transfer efficiency data is empirically based. 

\vspace{5mm}

The distributions of the freshwater transfer efficiencies are given in Figure \ref{dens_te}. The empirical observations are skewed-right, while the model-based observations appear bimodal (albeit with a small sample size--$n=4$). Combining the empirical and model-based estimates, the collective freshwater transfer efficiencies ($n=19$) range from 0.1\% to 22.3\% with a median of 8.4\%. When we calculate the average transfer (progressive) efficiency values provided in \citet{lindeman1942trophic}, we found that the average actually is 9\%. If we consider just transfer efficiencies between phytoplankton (trophic level 1) and zooplankton (trophic level 2), we found the median transfer efficiency to be 12.2\%. Unfortunately, the sample size in each group (i.e., trophic level and geographical region) is insufficiently large to draw any strong conclusions with relative certainty about which factors are the biggest sources of variation.

\subsection*{Marine}
Marine studies on transfer efficiency did not commence until decades after the start of freshwater studies. The popularity of marine transfer efficiency research has increased rapidly in the past 20 years and has overall now exceeded the number of freshwater studies. A total of 115 sites have transfer efficiency data (Table \ref{datamar}). In contrast to the freshwater studies, most marine transfer efficiency data ($n=134$) come from model-based studies rather than empirical experiments ($n=13$). Most marine studies report the average value for an entire system ($n=94$). In studies that focused on individual transfer efficiencies between specific trophic levels, most focused on the transfer efficiency between phytoplankton (trophic level 1) and zooplankton (trophic level 2).

\vspace{5mm}

The empirical and model-based transfer efficiency data both form skewed-right distributions with large amounts of dispersion around the 10\% value (Figure \ref{dens_te}). For model-based observations, there are a few outlying points from a study on bays and estuaries that skew the distribution (Figure \ref{dens_te}). The combined transfer efficiency data ranges from 0.2\% to 69\% with a median of 10.6\%, while the range constricts with a minimum of 3.12\% to a maximum of 27.2\% for just the marine empirical studies (Figure \ref{dens_te}). 

\vspace{5mm}

To explore the potential drivers of variation in transfer efficiencies, we calculated importance plots from the decision tree analysis. When interpreting importance plots, the larger the score, the more influential the variable. A number close to zero indicates the variables is not important and could be dropped. When determining the importance of a variable, the mean decrease in accuracy (i.e., mean square error, MSE) or the mean decrease in node impurity are used to measure how well the trees split the data. Thus, the relative importance plots from the decision tree analysis indicate that trophic level had the greatest influence on transfer efficiency, followed by the clustered region (i.e., temperate shelves and seas, tropical shelves and seas, lagoons, upwelling ecosystems, and open oceans) (Figure \ref{varimp}). The method employed (i.e., empirical or model-based) did not appear to be a useful predictor.  

\begin{figure}[H]

       \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig/var_imp_plot}

    \label{varimp}
\end{figure}

We combined results across both marine and freshwater systems to examine differences among trophic levels (Figure 5). We combined data for all the systems to increase the sample size. Whether the different densities are due to the sensitivity to small samples sizes or systematic differences is unclear. Nonetheless, our results support the hypothesis that transfer efficiency decreases as trophic level increases (see \citealt{garcia2012reconsidering}). This in turn supports the results from  \citet{may1983ecology} that in the marine environment ectotherms (invertebrates then vertebrates), which dominate the lower trophic levels, are more efficient than endotherms, which are more prominent at higher trophic levels (Figure \ref{den_tl}).

\section*{Discussion}
Overall, these studies show similarities between the two systems. The results give visual evidence that although the average transfer efficiency does not differ greatly from 10\%, there is substantial variation in transfer efficiency in both systems (Figure \ref{dens_te}). Additionally our study was able to identify that trophic level and the general geographic location of the ecosystem impacts the variability of the transfer efficiency. Some of this large variation seems to have predictable patterns, but the potential sources of this variation can only be explored for the larger sample sizes from marine systems. Thus in the absence of data, the distributions generated in the current study are good starting points to model the variation in transfer efficiency. 

\vspace{5mm}

We hypothesize the difference in transfer efficiency between trophic levels could be partially attributed to the composition of the taxa. Additionally, the differences could be due to the mobility of the organisms at each trophic levels and the amount of energy expedited to capture their prey. Both of these points highlight the need for additional research that can distinguish between the different mechanisms that influence transfer efficiency (e.g., endotherms vs. ectotherms).

\vspace{5mm}

We encountered two main difficulties in this study due to the different naming conventions in the early states (Figure \ref{foodweb} and \ref{flowchart}) and the different efficiencies of interest amongst different fields. We bring this point up to highlight the challenges in conducting interdisciplinary work. We found freshwater studies report either assimilation and consumption efficiencies or transfer efficiency, while the majority of marine papers focused on transfer efficiency. As previously mentioned, we found very few terrestrial studies that reported results on transfer efficiency. It is intriguing that the focus on transfer efficiency is an aquatic phenomenon. While we are unable to say with certainty why this is, we can speculate that in aquatic systems, and especially marine systems, it is extremely difficult to gather data on most species in an ecosystem. As a result, it is challenging to calculate the assimilation and consumption efficiencies in these systems. The great ease in counting terrestrial populations means the studies do not need to rely on more inferential, trophic level wide, techniques.

\vspace{5mm}

Despite the aforementioned limitations, we are able to demonstrate the 10\% value is problematic given the substantial variation that exists in the transfer efficiency. Even though the average and median values that emerge from the synthesis are not dramatically different from 10\%--which may suggest that an assumption of 10\% would be reasonable--by continuing to use a 10\% transfer efficiency researchers are eschewing the large variation and predictable patterns within this variation, which will impact a food web model?s ability to provide realistic results. From here on, we explore implications of applying a fixed 10\% transfer efficiency in ecology, fisheries, and aquaculture.

\subsection*{Applications in ecology}
When it comes to ecology, the transfer efficiency is used to understand food web dynamics and how various species interact and influence one another. Most commonly, it is used in size spectrum studies that explore predator-prey relationships \cite{barnes2010global}. In general though, the more detailed and species-specific assimilation efficiency is used more frequently in such analyses. Since many issues within ecology and conservation biology focus on individual species patterns, it is valuable to be able to calculate species-specific efficiencies. The transfer efficiency is perhaps too broad of a metric for many questions. While using a 10\% transfer efficiency value can have drastic underrepresentation and lead to severely mismanaged systems, given the preference for the assimilation efficiency the implications of a 10\% transfer efficiency most likely has not been directly measured in many cases in ecology. Previous research has shown distinct transfer efficiencies between trophic levels and for terrestrial (i.e., temperate forests, deciduous forests, and grasslands) and freshwater (i.e., lakes) systems \cite{hairston1993causeeffect}. Even though the assimilation and consumption efficiencies are different measures, there is comparable variation in them as there is in the transfer efficiency data, and therefore the implications of applying fixed values for these efficiencies could be the same as those for the transfer efficiency.

\subsection*{Applications in fisheries}
In fisheries, transfer efficiency is mostly used to determine the impact of fishing on a population. It can be used to estimate various metrics, such as biomass and the primary production required (PPR) given fisheries catch. Primary production required estimates the amount of net primary production needed to replace the biomass removed by fisheries landings. The idea is that primary production is a major limiting factor of fisheries catch. If biomass or the primary production required is incorrectly estimated, we risk the potential of under- or overfishing. 

\vspace{5mm}

What is the cost of ignoring variability in transfer efficiencies for fisheries applications? To explore this question, we reexamined the analyses by \citet{chassot2010global} and \citet{watson2014primary} of the primary production required to produce the biomass of fish that were caught. As an exploration, we recreated the analysis for one marine region, the California Current. We gathered annual catch data from Sea Around Us (\url{http://www.seaaroundus.org/}) from 1950 to 2014, trophic level data on fishes from Fishbase data base (\url{http://www.fishbase.org/}), and net primary production data on SeaWiFS from the Ocean Productivity web site (\url{http://www.science.oregonstate.edu/ocean.productivity/}). \citet{watson2014primary} also included trophic level data on invertebrates from SeaLifeBase; however, SeaLifeBase does not include trophic level data for the California Current. We first replicated the previously published results using a fixed 10\% transfer efficiency using the following equation\footnote{\citet{chassot2010global} specified ecosystem specific transfer efficiencies.}.

\begin{equation}
PPR_t = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{C_{i,t}}{CR}*\frac{1}{TE}^{TL_i-1}
\end{equation}

$PPR_t$ is the primary production required in year $t$ to produce the observed catch, $C_{i,t}$ is the biomass of catch for species $i$ in year $t$, $CR$ is the conversion rate of carbon to wet weight, $TE$ is the transfer efficiency, $TL_i$ is trophic level for species $i$, and $n$ is the number of species within a region. 

\vspace{5mm}

To explore the impact of ignoring variability in transfer efficiencies, we used the data we gathered on marine transfer efficiencies to test for sensitivities to transfer efficiency variability. We fit an approximate distribution to the marine transfer efficiency data using goodness-of-fit criterion so that we could randomly sample a value from the observed distribution instead of using a fixed 10\% value in the above equation (See supporting information for details). This approach allowed us to incorporate variability in the transfer efficiency. While the time span of the Sea Around Us catch data ran for over 60 years, we explored the distribution at 20 year intervals to get a sample of the changes in transfer efficiency. We constructed Monte Carlo simulations and ran 10,000 simulations for the years 1950, 1970, 1990, and 2010. Although it is difficult to compare our results directly to \citet{watson2014primary}, since their results are broken up by continental fishing fleets, we found that when transfer efficiency is allowed to vary, the projected PPR varies dramatically. Although the majority of the time the PPR is a sustainable fraction of the total production of the California Current, on average 47.18\% of the time (i.e., 46.93\% in 1950, 47.21\% in 1970, 47.35\% in 1990, and 47.22\% in 2010) the simulations suggest annual landings could exceed total primary production (Figure \ref{ppr}). Therefore, the application of a 10\% transfer efficiency in fisheries management has a high chance of leading to unsustainable fishing practices.

We adjusted the far right bin width due to rare events. The original range extends out further. Plot created using R v.3.4.3 \cite{Rcite} ggplot2 package v.2.2.1 \cite{ggplot}. }

\subsection*{Applications in aquaculture}
Aquaculture already cultivates hundreds of different marine and freshwater species. The relevance of transfer efficiencies to production decisions depends on whether the species requires additional feed or not. Non-fed aquaculture includes either primary producers or primary consumers that are not provided additional feeds by the aquaculturist. Fed aquaculture, on the other hand, involves consumer species that are typically fed compound feeds designed to meet their specific nutritional requirements. Consumption of autotrophs, usually phytoplankton by filter feeders, is studied extensively in non-fed aquaculture to track carrying capacity of ecosystems with added aquaculture \cite{banas2007tidal}. These carrying capacities are estimated using assimilation efficiencies of a specific target species \cite{rosland2009applying, irisarri2013absorption, srisunont2016estimating} or as broader estimates of transfer efficiencies \cite{simenstad1995influence, sommer1998algal, byron2011calculating, han2017evaluating}.

\vspace{5mm}

More and more fed species are given specialized compound feeds rather than whole organisms in order to increase efficiency and sustainability of feed resources. To assess the sustainability of feeds, the field has begun to track transfer efficiencies by dissecting the feed into its compositional parts and estimating the efficiencies for each of the components using the method devised by \citet{pauly1995primary}. While a 10\% transfer efficiency was initially employed to estimate the primary production requirements or biotic resource use in environmentally-based aquaculture assessments (e.g., \citealt{papatryphon2004environmental, pelletier2007feeding, pelletier2009not}), more recent studies have incorporated species-specific efficiencies in their analyses to better understand the environmental tradeoffs between different feed compositions \cite{cashion2016review}. Additionally, \citet{cashion2016review} found that the use of a 10\% transfer efficiency has led to an underestimation of the impacts of salmon aquaculture on natural marine biomass resources. Actual impacts are likely three times greater. As with the case for wild fisheries, ignoring the variability in transfer efficiencies can have negative impacts on the conservation of limited resources and management of human activities.

\section*{Concluding remarks}
Our results raise the question why the use of an assumed transfer efficiency value of 10\% is still so prevalent despite widespread evidence of substantial variability and examples of where the consequences of ignoring such variability have been documented? One issue is clearly convenience. The overall mean of observed values is not dramatically different from the assumed 10\% value. Nonetheless, given the scope of observed variation and uncertainty, using a 10\% value for the sake of arithmetic convenience carries large risks. Our study is not the first to raise this point, but synthesizing the full scope of evidence around the levels of variability and its potential consequences for decisions will hopefully highlight the costs of ignoring variability in this key ecosystem parameter. 

\vspace{5mm}

Another reason for the continued assumption of a constant value is the lack of relevant data for most systems. But our synthesis of the distributions of observed values for trophic efficiency in freshwater and marine ecosystems provides an opportunity to draw from this synthetic distribution rather than assuming a constant value. In cases where locally relevant data are infeasible to collect, this synthetic distribution may provide a better platform for decisions. 

\vspace{5mm}

Finally, one other issue is that the studies that have addressed the variability in transfer efficiency specifically have typically been in the context of narrower questions (e.g., aquaculture feeds). These narrower studies may not catch the attention of people using transfer efficiencies in other ways. By pulling together information from diverse studies from different fields, we hope this synthesis will generate a broader discussion.

\vspace{5mm}

In the absence of specific data for a broader array of systems, instead of using a fixed 10\% constant, we suggest using simulations or Bayesian models drawing on these synthetic distributions, which are great tools for incorporating variation and uncertainty. This approach would take us a long ways towards creating more valid food web models, and as such, improve our understanding on how food web dynamics impact community structure.
