	abstract = {A detailed energy flow model consisting of 56 living and 3 non-living compartments was assembled for the intertidal area of the Sylt-Rømø Bight. The model depicts the biomass of each compartment, carbon flow between the components, imports and exports, as well as an energy budget for each. The food web was analysed by means of network analysis which showed that about 17\% of the total daily flow through the system is recycled through a complex cycling structure consisting of 1197 cycles. The cycling network indicated that about 99\% of the recycling involves 2 to 3 compartments, with sediment bacteria and particulate organic carbon ({POC}) participating in most instances. Input/output analyses indicated that phytoplankton production in the Bight does not satisfy the demands of filter-feeders on an annual average basis so that about 160 mg C m–2 d–1 of phytoplankton have to be imported. We compared several dimensionless system level indices, such as internalised and normalised A/{DC} (ascendancy/development capacity) ratios, calculated for the Bight with those of other marine and estuarine ecosystems on a global basis. These comparisons showed that energy is rather inefficiently transferred within the Bight at a mean trophic efficiency index of 2.61\%, and that most of the system level indices are lower than those of other coastal ecosystems. However, higher values were obtained for flow diversity and food web connectance compared to other systems. This study has revealed the Bight to be a highly complex system whose energy pathways appear to be sensitive to external perturbations.},

	abstract = {Fisheries catches represent a net export of mass and energy that can no longer be used by trophic levels higher than those fished. Thus, exploitation implies a depletion of secondary production of higher trophic levels (here the production of mass and energy by herbivores and carnivores in the ecosystem) due to the removal of prey. The depletion of secondary production due to the export of biomass and energy through catches was recently formulated as a proxy for evaluating the ecosystem impacts of fishing–i.e., the level of ecosystem overfishing. Here we evaluate the historical and current risk of ecosystem overfishing at a global scale by quantifying the depletion of secondary production using the best available fisheries and ecological data (i.e., catch and primary production). Our results highlight an increasing trend in the number of unsustainable fisheries (i.e., an increase in the risk of ecosystem overfishing) from the 1950s to the 2000s, and illustrate the worldwide geographic expansion of overfishing. These results enable to assess when and where fishing became unsustainable at the ecosystem level. At present, total catch per capita from Large Marine Ecosystems is at least twice the value estimated to ensure fishing at moderate sustainable levels.},

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.1015782108},
	abstract = {Jellyfish blooms occur in many estuarine and coastal regions and may be increasing in their magnitude and extent worldwide. Voracious jellyfish predation impacts food webs by converting large quantities of carbon (C), fixed by primary producers and consumed by secondary producers, into gelatinous biomass, which restricts C transfer to higher trophic levels because jellyfish are not readily consumed by other predators. In addition, jellyfish release colloidal and dissolved organic matter (jelly-{DOM}), and could further influence the functioning of coastal systems by altering microbial nutrient and {DOM} pathways, yet the links between jellyfish and bacterioplankton metabolism and community structure are unknown. Here we report that jellyfish released substantial quantities of extremely labile C-rich {DOM}, relative to nitrogen (25.6 ± 31.6 C:1N), which was quickly metabolized by bacterioplankton at uptake rates two to six times that of bulk {DOM} pools. When jelly-{DOM} was consumed it was shunted toward bacterial respiration rather than production, significantly reducing bacterial growth efficiencies by 10\% to 15\%. Jelly-{DOM} also favored the rapid growth and dominance of specific bacterial phylogenetic groups (primarily γ-proteobacteria) that were rare in ambient waters, implying that jelly-{DOM} was channeled through a small component of the in situ microbial assemblage and thus induced large changes in community composition. Our findings suggest major shifts in microbial structure and function associated with jellyfish blooms, and a large detour of C toward bacterial {CO}2 production and away from higher trophic levels. These results further suggest fundamental transformations in the biogeochemical functioning and biological structure of food webs associated with jellyfish blooms.},

	abstract = {Body size exerts multiple effects on plankton food-web interactions. However, the influence of size structure on trophic transfer remains poorly quantified in the field. Here, we examine how the size diversity of prey (nano-microplankton) and predators (mesozooplankton) influence trophic transfer efficiency (using biomass ratio as a proxy) in natural marine ecosystems. Our results support previous studies on single trophic levels: transfer efficiency decreases with increasing prey size diversity and is enhanced with greater predator size diversity. We further show that communities with low nano-microplankton size diversity and high mesozooplankton size diversity tend to occur in warmer environments with low nutrient concentrations, thus promoting trophic transfer to higher trophic levels in those conditions. Moreover, we reveal an interactive effect of predator and prey size diversities: the positive effect of predator size diversity becomes influential when prey size diversity is high. Mechanistically, the negative effect of prey size diversity on trophic transfer may be explained by unicellular size-based metabolic constraints as well as trade-offs between growth and predation avoidance with size, whereas increasing predator size diversity may enhance diet niche partitioning and thus promote trophic transfer. These findings provide insights into size-based theories of ecosystem functioning, with implications for ecosystem predictive models.},

	abstract = {Studies were conducted to quantify how the size distribution of plankton affects ecological transfer efficiency in the pelagic food web. Simultaneous measurements of phytoplankton and zooplankton size (equivalent spherical diameter, {ESD}), biomass, and productivity were determined from bimonthly samples collected over a 13-month period at four pelagic sites in a large subtropical lake. Plankton {ESD} values were compared statistically with ratios of zooplankton:phytoplankton biomass and productivity, which served as two indices of ecological transfer efficiency. Communities dominated by large phytoplankton (generally filaments or colonies of cyanobacteria) and/or small-bodied zooplankton (rotifers and nauplii) displayed lower ratios of zooplankton:phytoplankton biomass than communities with smaller phytoplankton (nanoflagellates) and/or larger zooplankton (copepods and cladocerans). This pattern was robust, and was apparent both on inspection of data from individual sampling sites, and when all data were combined. Productivity ratios displayed the same general relationships with phyto- and zooplankton {ESD}, although those patterns were evident only when data were examined on a site-by-site basis. Overall, the results supported the hypothesis that when the pelagic community is dominated by large phytoplankton and small zooplankton, only a small fraction of the carbon fixed by photosynthesis is passed directly to the herbivore trophic level. At such times, alternative routes for carbon flow may predominate, including bacterial-based pathways with protozoa as intermediate consumers, or direct links from phytoplankton to fish.},

The multispecies framework treats the single-species models and data as a special case of the multispecies model and data. The same data from fisheries and surveys are used to estimate model parameters for both single-species and multispecies configurations of the model. Additionally, data from stomach samples and predator rations are used to estimate the parameters of the multispecies model. One form of the feeding functional response, predator pre-emption, was selected using AIC from seven alternative models for how the predation rate changes with the densities of prey and possibly other predators. Differences in estimated population dynamics and productivity between the multispecies and single-species models were observed. The multispecies model estimated lower mackerel population sizes from 1964–2003 than the single-species model, while the spawning biomass of pollock was estimated to have declined more than three times faster since 1964 by the multispecies model. The variances around the estimates of spawning biomass were smaller for mackerel and larger for pollock in the multispecies model compared to the single-species model.},

These indices can, however, be misleading because changes over time in catch rates can occur because of factors other than changes in abundance. Catch-effort standardization is used to attempt to remove the impact of these factors. This paper reviews the current state of the art in the methods for standardizing catch and effort data. It outlines the major estimation approaches being applied, the methods for dealing with zero observations, how to identify and select appropriate explanatory variables, and how standardized catch rate data can be used when conducting stock assessments.},

	abstract = {Robert May's seminal book has played a central role in the development of ecological science. Originally published in 1976, this influential text has overseen the transition of ecology from an observational and descriptive subject to one with a solid conceptual core. Indeed, it is a testament to its influence that a great deal of the novel material presented in the earlier editions has now been incorporated into standard undergraduate textbooks. It is now a quarter of a century since the publication of the second edition, and a thorough revision is timely. Theoretical Ecology provides a succinct, up-to-date overview of the field set in the context of applications, thereby bridging the traditional division of theory and practice. It describes the recent advances in our understanding of how interacting populations of plants and animals change over time and space, in response to natural or human-created disturbance. In an integrated way, initial chapters give an account of the basic principles governing the structure, function, and temporal and spatial dynamics of populations and communities of plants and animals. Later chapters outline applications of these ideas to practical issues including fisheries, infectious diseases, tomorrow's food supplies, climate change, and conservation biology. Throughout the book, emphasis is placed on questions which as yet remain unanswered. The editors have invited the top scientists in the field to collaborate with the next generation of theoretical ecologists. The result is an accessible, advanced textbook suitable for senior undergraduate and graduate level students as well as researchers in the fields of ecology, mathematical biology, environment and resources management. It will also be of interest to the general reader seeking a better understanding of a range of global environmental problems.},

Giacomini favored the former, invoking in support the energetic equivalence hypothesis. We reply that the energetic equivalence hypothesis does not describe populations at differing trophic levels and so does not refute a significant role for body-mass dependence in explaining faster trophic transfer in pelagic ecosystems. Metabolic scaling as body mass to the exponent 1/4, widely accepted, remains important for trophic dynamic models. We suggest a likelihood method to compare the two hypotheses on the basis of models of whole-ecosystem energetics.},

	url = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/40235160},
	abstract = {The transfer of energy and nutrients from plants to animals is a key process in all ecosystems. In lakes, inefficient transfer of primary producer derived energy can result in low animal growth rates, accumulation of nuisance phytoplankton blooms and dissipation of energy from the ecosystem. Most research on carbon transfer efficiency in pelagic food webs has focused on either food quantity or food quality, with the latter considered separately as either elemental stoichiometry or biochemical composition. The natural occurrence and magnitude of these types of growth limitations and their combined effects on Daphnia, a keystone grazer in pelagic freshwater ecosystems, are largely unknown. Our empirical models predict that the strength and nature of food quantity and quality limitation varies greatly with lake trophic state (total phosphorus, {TP}) and that Daphnia growth rates and thus energy and nutrient transfer efficiency are highest in lakes with intermediate trophic status ({TP} 10-25 µg 1⁻¹). We predict that food availability place the greatest constraint on Daphnia growth in nutrient poor lakes ({TP} ≤ 4 µg 1⁻¹). Phosphorus limitation of Daphnia growth increased with decreasing {TP}, but the overall effect was never predicted to be the dominant constraining factor. Eicosapentaenoic acid ({EPA}, 20:5ω3) limitation was predicted to occur in both nutrient poor and nutrient rich lakes and placed the primary constraint on food quality in the most productive lakes. Two contrasting {EPA}-models gave different results on the magnitude of {EPA}-limitation, implying that additional food quality factors decrease Daphnia growth at high {TP}. In conclusion, the model predicts that Daphnia growth should peak in mesotrophic lakes, food quantity will place the greatest constraint on growth in oligotrophic lakes and {EPA} will primarily limit growth in eutrophic lakes.},

Dynamics were estimated using large-scale spatial data and a fully integrated length-based and age-structured model. The model used fishery-dependent catch, size composition and catch per unit effort (CPUE) as likelihood components. Time-varying selectivity patterns were used in the modelling to account for changes in fishing practices. Estimates of fishing intensity showed a pattern of exploitation generally exceeding the levels associated with maximum sustainable yield (MSY). Estimates of spawning biomass and recruitment described a population that was relatively stable near biomass levels associated with MSY until the 1990s, when recruitment declined and biomass levels fell below those associated with MSY. The reduction in recruitment could be explained by a loss of spawning biomass and potentially changes in environment. The future prospects of rebuilding the stock will depend on the relative importance of the roles maternal biomass and environment play in determining recruitment strength.},

When there are no systematic changes in catchability, all the methods tested work reasonably well, even in the presence of substantial random noise (Coefficients of Variance of the order of 50\%) in both the catch numbers and effort data. However, systematic trends in catchability may cause gross errors or failure of all current methods except the Rho method, and even this may fail if the trends are sufficiently strong. A new method is proposed which has a low bias and variability, even in the presence of strong trends and noise and which should be fairly widely applicable.},

	abstract = {This study describes the feeding ecology of three pelagic shark species in the California Current: shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus); blue (Prionace glauca); and thresher (Alopias vulpinus) sharks. Stomach contents of sharks collected from 2002 to 2008 were identified to the lowest taxonomic level and analyzed using univariate and multivariate methods. Of 330 mako sharks sampled (53 to 248 cm fork length [FL]), 238 stomachs contained 42 prey taxa, with jumbo squid (Dosidicus gigas) and Pacific saury (Cololabis saira) representing the most important prey based on the geometric index of importance (GII). In addition, 158 blue sharks were sampled (76 to 248 cm FL) and 114 stomachs contained 38 prey taxa, with jumbo and Gonatus spp. squids representing the most important prey. Lastly, 225 thresher sharks were sampled (108 to 228 cm FL) and 157 stomachs contained 18 prey taxa with northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) and Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) identified as the most important prey. Overall, mako sharks had the most diverse diet based upon Simpson’s diversity index (1/D) (8.43 ± 1.16), feeding on many species of teleosts and cephalopods, followed by blue sharks (6.20 ± 2.11) which consumed a wide range of prey (primarily cephalopods), while thresher sharks were most specialized (2.62 ± 0.34), feeding primarily on coastal pelagic teleosts. Dietary overlap was lowest between blue and thresher sharks (Sørensen similarity index = 0.321 and Simplified Morisita Horn index = 0.006), and seasonal variability in diet was greatest for blue sharks (Simplified Morisita Horn index = 0.260, Analysis of Similarity (ANOSIM) p {\textless} 0.001). In addition, size class, and subregion were significant factors that affected diet of each species differently (ANOSIM p {\textless} 0.001). Despite similarities in life history characteristics and spatial and temporal overlap in habitat, diets of these three common shark species are distinct in the California Current.},

Plankton size spectra are an effective approach of summarising the size structure of the community and have the potential to indicate the transfer of energy up the trophic food web. However, data on which open ocean plankton biomass-size structure can be constructed are scarce. Here we present the latitudinal distribution in the Atlantic Ocean of normalised biomass-size spectra ({NB}-S), plankton biomass and abundance, as well as mean zooplankton size between 70°N and 50°S. Samples were collected from three Atlantic Meridional Transect ({AMT}) cruises during May/June 2003, September/October 2003 and April/June 2004, as well as from a Marine Productivity ({MarProd}) cruise farther north in the Irminger Sea during spring 2002. The biomass-size distribution covered a body size range from nano- to mesoplankton and was based on a depth range of 50–0m on the {AMT} and 120–0m on the Irminger Sea cruise. The distribution of normalised biomass versus size was linear on a double log plot at all of the 95 stations. The slopes of the {NB}-S spectra ranged from −0.93 to −1.26 and −1.12 to −1.46 on the {AMT} and Irminger Sea cruises, respectively. A “dome-shaped” pattern in the slopes of community size spectra was observed in the Atlantic, indicating a decrease in the trophic transfer efficiency of energy with increasing latitude and phytoplankton biomass. Mesozooplankton biomass, abundance, and mean size followed a distribution similar to ecosystem productivity.},

	abstract = {An important goal in ecology is developing general theory on how the species composition of ecosystems is related to ecosystem properties and functions. Progress on this front is limited partly because of the need to identify mechanisms controlling functions that are common to a wide range of ecosystem types. We propose that one general mechanism, rooted in the evolutionary ecology of all species, is adaptive foraging behavior in response to predation risk. To support our claim, we present two kinds of empirical evidence from plant?based and detritus?based food chains of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. The first kind comes from experiments that explicitly trace how adaptive foraging influences ecosystem properties and functions. The second kind comes from a synthesis of studies that individually examine complementary components of particular ecosystems that together provide an integrated perspective on the link between adaptive foraging and ecosystem function. We show that the indirect effects of predators on plant diversity, plant productivity, nutrient cycling, trophic transfer efficiencies, and energy flux caused by consumer foraging shifts in response to risk are qualitatively different from effects caused by reductions in prey density due to direct predation. We argue that a perspective of ecosystem function that considers effects of consumer behavior in response to predation risk will broaden our capacity to explain the range of outcomes and contingencies in trophic control of ecosystems. This perspective also provides an operational way to integrate evolutionary and ecosystem ecology, which is an important challenge in ecology.},

	abstract = {The energetic relation between different trophic levels and populations in a community involves primarily potential energy transfer in complex feed-back systems, making the applicability of existing steady state thermodynamic theory questionable, since the requirements for direct evaluation of entropy are not met by ecological systems. The only form of energy considered here was potential energy. The efficiency of a population does not have a unique meaning. Three different concepts of efficiency were defined and evaluated for Daphnia pulex. Two of these, the ecological efficiency and population efficiency, refer to the population level. The growth efficiency refers to individual organisms. Ecological efficiency is a function of the rate of removal of yield and of the kind of yield animals removed. Population efficiency is a function of the kind of animals removed as yield and the interaction between these animals and the population. Growth efficiency does not depend on the removal of yield at all. It is a function of individual food consumption, growth rate and the energetic cost of reproduction. These three are interrelated. In general, for a particular system of predation ecological efficiency is proportional to population efficiency. Population efficiency is related to the individual growth efficiency through the effect of the removal of animals on the maintenance cost per calorie of standing crop, which in turn is a function of growth efficiency. The maximum ecological efficiencies found in the Daphnia experiments are of the same order as ecological efficiencies found in nature, implying that ecological efficiency is effectively constant. Presumably the observed value of c. ten per cent has selective significance. In speculating on the future development of community ecology, I suggested that certain generalizations now available, including the approximate constancy of ecological efficiency, restrict the development of possible theories. When a sufficient number of these generalizations have been stated and tested a comprehensive predictive general theory of community ecology will appear, if only by the elimination of all conceivable theories whose predictions do not conform to the generalizations.},

	abstract = {Food chain length is an important property of ecosystems, but the mechanisms maintaining it remain elusive. Classical views suggest that energetic inefficiencies (the ?energy?flow hypothesis?) limit food chain length, but others have argued that better explanations reside in more complex scenarios that consider the stability of food webs or the combined effects of productivity and ecosystem size. We argue that abandonment of the energy?flow hypothesis is premature. For a simple tritrophic rocky intertidal food chain, we show that the efficiency of energy transfer is strongly influenced by predation risk and consumer density. Effects tied to predation risk were particularly strong, explaining 32\% of the variation in growth efficiency (compared to 15\% for density effects) and reducing it by 44?76\%. Hence, the stress (fear of being eaten) that predators impose on prey may be instrumental in limiting energy transfer up the food chain and thus contribute to the shortening of food chains.},

	abstract = {Adequate conservation and management of shark populations is becoming increasingly important on a global scale, especially because many species are exceptionally vulnerable to overfishing. Yet, reported catch statistics for sharks are incomplete, and mortality estimates have not been available for sharks as a group. Here, the global catch and mortality of sharks from reported and unreported landings, discards, and shark finning are being estimated at 1.44 million metric tons for the year 2000, and at only slightly less in 2010 (1.41 million tons). Based on an analysis of average shark weights, this translates into a total annual mortality estimate of about 100 million sharks in 2000, and about 97 million sharks in 2010, with a total range of possible values between 63 and 273 million sharks per year. Further, the exploitation rate for sharks as a group was calculated by dividing two independent mortality estimates by an estimate of total global biomass. As an alternative approach, exploitation rates for individual shark populations were compiled and averaged from stock assessments and other published sources. The resulting three independent estimates of the average exploitation rate ranged between 6.4\% and 7.9\% of sharks killed per year. This exceeds the average rebound rate for many shark populations, estimated from the life history information on 62 shark species (rebound rates averaged 4.9\% per year), and explains the ongoing declines in most populations for which data exist. The consequences of these unsustainable catch and mortality rates for marine ecosystems could be substantial. Global total shark mortality, therefore, needs to be reduced drastically in order to rebuild depleted populations and restore marine ecosystems with functional top predators.},
